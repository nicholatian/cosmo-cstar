    “Seymour Cray didn't care that 81.0/3.0 did not give exactly
     27.0 on the CDC 6000 class machines; and he was universally
     respected for making the fastest machines around.

Your Cosmopolitan TinyMath library provides hardware-accelerated scalar
transcendental mathematical functions that are superior to the portable
standards-compliant math library, in terms of both performance and code
size, by trading away focus on temporal concerns, like IEEE conformance
or rounding errors at the femto-scale, or reproducible results across a
broad array of niche machine languages.
