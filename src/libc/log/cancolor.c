/**
 * Returns true if ANSI terminal colors are appropriate.
 *
 * We take an optimistic approach here. We use colors, unless we see the
 * environment variable TERM=dumb, which is set by software like Emacs.
 * It's a common antipattern to check isatty(STDERR_FILENO), since that
 * usually makes colors harder to get than they are to remove:
 *
 *      sed 's/\x1b\[[;[:digit:]]*m//g' <color.txt >uncolor.txt
 *
 * Ideally, all software should be updated to understand color, since
 * it's been formally standardized nearly as long as ASCII. Even old
 * MS-DOS supports it (but Windows didn't until Windows 10) yet even
 * tools like less may need wrapper scripts, e.g.:
 *
 *      #!/bin/sh
 *      LESSCHARSET=UTF-8 exec /usr/bin/less -RS "$@"
 *
 * It's that easy fam.
