ERROR

  Thompson Shell Backwards Compatibility Issue Detected

DETAILS

  Actually Portable Executable assumes stock Linux configuration.
  Normal behavior is non-ELF files with x bit are run by /bin/sh.
  Linux lets people globally define arbitrary magic interpreters.
  Your computer couldve been tuned to run MZ scripts inside WINE.
  So if you use binfmt_misc you need to explicitly register this.

WORKAROUND

  sudo sh -c "echo ':APE:M::MZqFpD::/bin/sh:' >/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register"
